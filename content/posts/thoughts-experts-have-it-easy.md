While scrolling hacker news, I came across a [great article](https://boydkane.com/essays/experts) by Boyd Kane about how novices don't just lack knowledge of a subject, but lack _the awareness_ of their lack of knowledge until it is pointed out to them by a friendly expert. His recommendation to novices is to study a niche aspect of their field so that they can speak on the "same level" as other experts as a way of finding common ground:

> Spending a week exploring some specific arcana of your field is probably going to pay dividends, because all of a sudden you're expert-level in this (tiny) aspect of the field. You can go head-to-head with an expert, since they last read about that weird subdomain 5 years ago. Donâ€™t study the "common" things, but go all-in on the niche pockets.

While I don't disagree, I feel that Boyd missed the biggest reason for why this is great advice (ironically so, since he talks about how experts can rarely communicate _why_ something is a good idea in an intelligible way).

In my opinion, the greatest advantage to studying a niche topic for a week or so is that you can take the knowledge you gained and apply it to new situations outside of that niche. As you continue to pick up new bits of information, your mental toolkit will grow along with it. In the modern software industry, languages, libraries, and platforms are constantly in flux. The technology _du jour_ may not exist a year from now. By taking these time-boxed deep dives, you will start to develop a sixth sense about what works and what doesn't.

"The Hunch", as I call it, is a sixth sense that I believe all expert engineers share. It is not limited to one paradigm or one tech stack. It is an intuition forged from and honed with every production bug, every mind-numbing debugging session, each easy-to-miss mistake fixed, and every poorly designed feature rectified over time.

Lately, I have been doing a lot of `c++` development and have found that my hunch is still very present (even though I've primarily used `java` and `javascript` throughout my career). While it doesn't help me with syntax or libraries, it does help me with asking good questions, parsing through terrible documentation, thinking laterally to solve a problem, and understanding best practices. This gave me quite the headstart over other novices.

All in all, I don't think you can go wrong following Boyd's advice. That same advice is what has helped me to become a better engineer every day.
